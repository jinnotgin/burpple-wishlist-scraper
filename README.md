# burpple-wishlist-scraper
 
This repository contains the scripts necessary to collect all burpple wishlists data, and will serve the resulting json file to https://faveats.net (source: https://github.com/jinnotgin/nearby-favourite-eats-ui)

A worker will be regularly updating the json files, with a new commit made everytime there are changes detected.
